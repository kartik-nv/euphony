LYRICS:<br>
You were the shadow to my light<br>
Did you feel us?<br>
Another start<br>
You fade away<br>
Afraid our aim is out of sight<br>
Wanna see us<br>
Alive<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Was it all in my fantasy?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Were you only imaginary?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Atlantis<br>
Under the sea<br>
Under the sea<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Another dream<br>
The monster's running wild inside of me<br>
I'm faded<br>
I'm faded<br>
So lost, I'm faded<br>
I'm faded<br>
So lost, I'm faded<br>
I'm faded<br>
These shallow waters, never met<br>
What I needed<br>
I'm letting go – a deeper dive<br>
Eternal silence of the sea – I'm breathing<br>
Alive<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Under the bright – but faded lights<br>
You've set my heart on fire<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Atlantis<br>
Under the sea<br>
Under the sea<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Another dream<br>
The monster's running wild inside of me<br>
I'm faded<br>
I'm faded<br>
So lost, I'm faded<br>
I'm faded<br>
So lost, I'm faded<br>
