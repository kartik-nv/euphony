    LYRICS:<br>
    Baby, I'm not even in a gown<br>
    I'm just in a t-shirt on the couch<br>
    The way you want me makes me want you now<br>
    The only thing you have to say is (Wow)<br>
    And I feel this way with no chemicals in my system<br>
    Babe, it's incredible<br>
    When you're touching me, yeah, that says it all<br>
    You said it all (Yeah)<br>
    Baby, I'm not even in a gown<br>
    I'm just in a t-shirt on the couch<br>
    The way you want me makes me want you now<br>
    The only thing you have to say is (Wow)<br>
    Make your jaw drop-drop<br>
    Saying, my, drop-drop-drop<br>
    Make you say "Oh my god"<br>
    My, drop-drop<br>
    Make your jaw drop<br>
    Make you say "Oh my god"<br>
    And you never felt this type of emotion<br>
    Make your jaw drop-drop<br>
    Saying, my, drop-drop-drop<br>
    Make you say "Oh my god"<br>
    My, drop-drop<br>
    Make your jaw drop<br>
    Make you say "Oh my god"<br>
    And you never felt this type of emotion<br>
    Make your jaw drop-drop<br>
    Saying, my, drop-drop-drop<br>
    Make you say "Oh my god"<br>
    My, drop-drop<br>
    Make your jaw drop<br>
    Make you say "Oh my god"<br>
    And you never felt this type of emotion<br>
    And you make me feel so fucking pretty<br>
    Take loving me to a new extreme<br>
    If I can't have you, I don't want no one<br>
    I don't want no one<br>
    As you make me dance in the middle of the street<br>
    On the hardwood floor, we should be asleep<br>
    If I can't have you, I don't want no one<br>
    I don't want no one, want no one, want no one<br>
    Baby, I'm not even in a gown<br>
    I'm just in a t-shirt on the couch<br>
    The way you want me makes me want you now<br>
    The only thing you have to say is (Wow)<br>
    Make your jaw drop-drop<br>
    Saying, my, drop-drop-drop<br>
    Make you say "Oh my god"<br>
    My, drop-drop<br>
    Make your jaw drop<br>
    Make you say "Oh my god"<br>
    And you never felt this type of emotion<br>
    Make your jaw drop-drop<br>
    Saying, my, drop-drop-drop<br>
    Make you say "Oh my god"<br>
    My, drop-drop<br>
    Make your jaw drop<br>
    Make you say "Oh my god"<br>
    And you never felt this type of emotion<br>
    Never, never, never, oh<br>
    Never, never, never, oh<br>
    Never, never, never, oh<br>
    Never, never, never, oh<br>
