<p>
    If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea<br>
    I'll sail the world to find you<br>
    If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see<br>
    I'll be the light to guide you<br>
    We'll find out what we're made of<br>
    When we are called to help our friends in need<br>
    You can count on me like one, two, three<br>
    I'll be there<br>
    And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two<br>
    You'll be there<br>
    'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah<br>
    Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah<br>
    If you tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep<br>
    I'll sing a song beside you<br>
    And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me<br>
    Everyday I will remind you, oh<br>
    We'll find out what we're made of<br>
    When we are called to help our friends in need<br>
    You can count on me like one, two, three<br>
    I'll be there<br>
    And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two<br>
    You'll be there<br>
    'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah<br>
    Yeah, yeah<br>
    You'll always have my shoulder when you cry<br>
    I'll never let go, never say goodbye<br>
    You, you can count on me like one, two, three<br>
    I'll be there<br>
    And I know when I need it I can count on you like four, three, two<br>
    And you'll be there<br>
    'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah<br>
    You can count on me 'cause I can count on you<br>
