<p>
    It's you<br>
    It's always you<br>
    If I'm ever gonna fall in love<br>
    I know it's gon' be you<br>
    It's you<br>
    It's always you<br>
    Met a lot of people<br>
    But nobody feels like you<br>
    So please don't break my heart<br>
    Don't tear me apart<br>
    I know how it starts<br>
    Trust me I've been broken before<br>
    Don't break me again<br>
    I am delicate<br>
    Please don't break my heart<br>
    Trust me I've been broken before<br>
    I've been broken, yeah<br>
    I know how it feels<br>
    To be open<br>
    And then find out your love isn't real<br>
    I'm still hurting, yeah<br>
    I'm hurting inside<br>
    I'm so scared to fall in love<br>
    But if it's you then I'll try<br>
    It's you<br>
    It's always you<br>
    If I'm ever gonna fall in love<br>
    I know it's gon' be you<br>
    It's you<br>
    It's always you<br>
    Met a lot of people<br>
    But nobody feels like you<br>
    So please, don't break my heart<br>
    Don't tear me apart<br>
    I know how it starts<br>
    Trust me I've been broken before<br>
    Don't break me again<br>
    I am delicate<br>
    Please, don't break my heart<br>
    Trust me I've been broken before<br>
    No, I'm not the best at choosing lovers<br>
    We both know my past speaks for itself<br>
    If you don't think that we're right for each other<br>
    Then please don't let history repeat itself<br>
    'Cause I want you<br>
    I want you<br>
    There's nothing else I want<br>
    'Cause I want you<br>
    I want you<br>
    And you're the only thing I want<br>
    It's you<br>
    It's always you<br>
    If I'm ever gonna fall in love<br>
    I know it's gon' be you<br>
    It's you<br>
    It's always you<br>
    Met a lot of people<br>
    But nobody feels like you<br>
    So please, don't break my heart<br>
    Don't tear me apart<br>
    I know how it starts<br>
    Trust me I've been broken before<br>
    Don't break me again<br>
    I am delicate<br>
    Please don't break my heart<br>
    Trust me I've been broken before<br>
