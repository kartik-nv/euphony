    Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>
    Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>
    You say you love me, I say you crazy<br>
    We're nothing more than friends<br>
    You're not my lover, more like a brother<br>
    I known you since we were like ten, yeah<br>
    Don't mess it up, talking that shit<br>
    Only gonna push me away, that's it<br>
    When you say you love me, that make me crazy<br>
    Here we go again<br>
    Don't go look at me with that look in your eye<br>
    You really ain't going away without a fight<br>
    You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite<br>
    I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times<br>
    Haven't I made it obvious?<br>
    Haven't I made it clear?<br>

    Have you got no shame? You looking insane<br>
    Turning up at my door<br>
    It's two in the morning, the rain is pouring<br>
    Haven't we been here before?<br>
    Don't mess it up, talking that shit<br>
    Only gonna push me away, that's it<br>
    Have you got no shame? You looking insane<br>
    Here we go again<br>
    So don't go look at me with that look in your eye<br>
