<h1>Dusk till Dawn</h1>
<h2>~Zayn Malik</h2>
<p>Not tryna be indie<br>
Not tryna be cool<br>
Just tryna be in this<br>
Tell me how you choose<br>
Can you feel why you're in this<br>
Can you feel it through<br>
All of the windows<br>
Inside this room<br>
'Cause I wanna touch you, baby<br>
And I wanna feel you, too<br>
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins<br>
Just me and you<br>
Light it up, on the run<br>
Let's make love, tonight<br>
Make it up, fall in love, try<br>
But you'll never be alone<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
Baby, I'm right here<br>
I'll hold you when things go wrong<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
Baby, I'm right here<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
Baby, I'm right here<br>
We were shut like a jacket<br>
So do your zip<br>
We will roll down the rapids<br>
To find a wave that fits<br>
Can you feel where the wind is<br>
Can you feel it through<br>
All of the windows<br>
Inside this room<br>
'Cause I wanna touch you, baby<br>
I wanna feel you, too<br>
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins<br>
Just me and you<br>
Light it up, on the run<br>
Let's make love tonight<br>
Make it up, fall in love, try<br>
But you'll never be alone<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till <br>
Baby, I'm right here<br>
I'll hold you when things go wrong<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
Baby, I'm right here<br>
Go, give love to your body<br>
It's only you that can stop it<br>
Go, give love to your body<br>
It's only you that can stop it<br>
Go, give love to your body<br>
It's only you that can stop it<br>
Go, give love to your body<br>
Go, give love to your body<br>
But you'll never be alone<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
Baby, I'm right here<br>
I'll hold you when things go wrong<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
Baby, I'm right here<br>
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
Baby, I'm right here</p>
